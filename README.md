## What do we need? 

### index.html file
It is what we sent to the client and what React will render the app into.

### Support for ES6

### Webpack
To build the app as well as css modules. Also to serve the app during development.

### Root Component
A container that holds the rest of our app components.

### React-hold-loader
To see the changes immediately during development without the need to refresh the app each time.
